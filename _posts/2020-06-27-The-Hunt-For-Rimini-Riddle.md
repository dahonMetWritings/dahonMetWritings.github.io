## The Hunt For Rimini Riddle

What Are You Looking At?
	You may have heard the name “Rimini Riddle” around the internet here and there. But in case you haven’t, it's basically… 

(insert gif here)

 That. Okay there’s more to it than. 

   The premise of the show is basically Gravity Falls but everyone looks like Eminem’s mom. You got these kids, not Dipper, not Mabel, and also not Mabel. They get sent to live with the greedy sibling of one of their parents. There’s also some spooky-mystery shenanigans the kids gotta deal with. Like a portrait of these little girls who drowned in the ocean. That their aunt just has, hanging around. Or not-Dipper’s toy otter being some baby-eating demon.

There are more differences it has from Gravity Falls. Besides everyone looking like...

   there’s the half-melted candle looking-guy that’s trying to get Aunt Vera’s dosh. There are also these blackface-looking cats that make me want to unsee everything. They’re called the Conger Sisters.

   As far as non-diegetic stuff goes, the show was aired on the network, RTE, and produced by eircom. The former’s clearly going strong today while the latter seemingly hasn’t existed since the 90’s. Speaking of which, the show aired between 1992 and 1995.

   So how does this all add up? What is the Conger Sisters’ relation to any of the characters I mentioned? What are the personalities of the three main characters? Why is this house called the Rimini house? Why is Otto a bastard?

   Yeah that’s the thing. Nobody knows anything about it. ‘Cause the show’s lost. Actually we know who was in those puppets’ butts, but other than that, and all this info, we know jack about it. Which is why I decided to research whoever had their names on RTE’s website in relation to the show.


Who's Responsible? Note - Get more info on what these cats actually did holy shit

I tried emailing RTE themselves.

Didn’t go so well. But I also tried to contact these other guys.

Dominic Moore
(image)	This guy seemed to be pretty important to this show. I’m guessing he’s the creator. He’s done more than Rimini Riddle, such as the Bashur Bacon dude. He also seemed to just totally get wiped off the face of the Earth two years ago. So that sucks.

David McKenna
So this guy’s the director there’s gotta be some information on-(insert gif here)

Brendan O’ Connor
He played Geoffrey. You know, this guy (cut to pic of Geoffrey). Going off [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCrSTBRkqUY) at least. Dude was a one hit wonder, a comedian, writer, and probably did some other stuff Wikipedia didn’t mention.


Where's It Now?
   Naturally, something as strange, mysterious, and frankly meme-worthy as this would spark the interest of internet losers. *ahem* That leaves us with the question, where is it? …

   Were you not listening you knobhead, I just said it was lost. Even the people who worked on it are lost. Not that that’s gonna stop us. The cool thing about internet losers is that when they’re fixated on something, it takes them a long-ass while to give up on it, no matter how much of a lost cause it is. Or was in the case of people who spent 10 years looking for a frickin’ Pinwheel sketch. Whatever the hell Pinwheel is.

   Am I optimistic about us uncovering all 65 episodes of this thing? Nah. But, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t think it’d be cool. And I’d be lying even harder if I said I wouldn’t love to see a reboot of this thing. Gravity Falls proves a show like this can work, Over the Garden Wall proves horror-dramas can work for kids. Frankly this more mature and complex era of children's television is just begging for a revival of this. Wink wink nudge nudge RT-aaand no one at RTE’s watching this. Well, on the off chance someone at RTE is and thinking about a reboot, maybe have it not look like 


Why?
   The real people who worked on this show aren’t the only mysteries. The puppets of the people in the world of this show on this network in this country of Ireland in th-(insert funny sound effect here)
are pretty mysterious too. Or at the very least, mysterious looking.

   One of the first concepts that should come to your mind when looking at this show is the ‘Uncanny Valley’. Hell, just how uncanny the puppets look is really the only thing people who’ve seen this show can take away from it.

   At first, I was gonna rant about how bad these designs were because these mofos are butt-ugly. But then I realized, maybe this is intentional. This is a dramatic horror, with little-to-no light hearted story beats. Compare this show’s “art style” with what’s probably it's modern day counterpart, Gravity Falls. Gravity Falls, while often really dark and scary for young audiences has a fairly cute and cartoony art style. 

(insert comic here commenting on the CalArts style)

This is because Gravity Falls is meant to be a fun kids show. Yes it gets hella dark, but the fact it starts out as a simple, albeit really funny and often heartwarming kids adventure makes the darker moments so much more entertaining. 

If this show’s backstory and people’s accounts of it are true, this isn’t meant to be fun in the same way. This show would always be dark, like if Adventure Time was only about the Great Mushroom War, or if Steven Universe was only about the Gem War. You aren’t meant to find the world of Rimini Riddle charmingly quirky like Gravity Falls, or the Land of Ooo, or Steven Universe’s… Universe. You’re meant to find it unsettling. Scary. As strange as it is inviting.

Kinda like the world of lost media itself.
